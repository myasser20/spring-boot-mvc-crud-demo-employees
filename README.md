Employees management system using Spring Boot 3 with Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, AOP (with full database CRUD real-time project). 
Spring MVC will handle the web layer, Thymeleaf will generate dynamic HTML templates, and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) will enable cross-cutting concerns like logging and performance monitoring. The system will provide full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee data, ensuring real-time updates and a user-friendly interface.
- CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete employee records.
- Employee Details: Display detailed information for each employee (e.g., contact details, salary, job title).
- AOP: Implement AOP to log method calls, exceptions, and performance metrics.
